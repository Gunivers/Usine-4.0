# Note:
# - This function takes inputs in [1; 1 000 000 000] (corresponds to [0.001; 1 000 000]). If you want log(0.5), input 500
# - The output values are scaled by 10 000. They are the exact result +- 0.002 (The maximum error is 0.0017, 90% of the errors are < 0.001)
# - Thanks to this guy for the formula used in this function: https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/977586/is-there-an-approximation-to-the-natural-log-function-at-large-values
# - If you input 0 the function returns log(0.001), if you input a negative value it returns log(-x)
